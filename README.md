## üîé **About me**

This might be the only CV you read from a dev who's helped write a book on why programming is a craft by interviewing shepards in the Lake District. I am a recent graduate of the mighty Makers Academy software development bootcamp but my background is building creative solutions and processes that make peoples lives easier, whether that was as a Development Manager in the LGBTQ+ charity sector or a Solutions Consultant or Project Manager with SaaS products. 

 I've put 'Full Stack Software Developer' rather grandly at the top there ‚¨ÜÔ∏è and, sure, I have learned a **huge** amount during 16 weeks of bootcamp but I can't pretend to be a seasoned engineer. I can say though, without any hesitation, that I love coding, learning new skills and working in teams of smart people building machines out of words. 

## üíª **Projects**
| Project | Description | Technologies |
|---  |---  |---  |

A web application that connects foodbanks with local restaurents, supermarkets and other businesses who have surplus food that would otherwise go to waste.  | NodeJS, React, HTML, CSS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, Cypress, Jest |
| [**Acebook**](https://github.com/ManuelaIacobovici/acebook-mern-water-team/tree/main) | During this group project, we were asked to create a Facebook clone. Throughout its course we focused on an Agile working style, using Trello, daily stand-ups and regular retros to guide this MERN project. | NodeJS, React, HTML, CSS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, Cypress, Jest |
